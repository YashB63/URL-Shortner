# URL-Shortner
A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and converts it into a shorter, more compact version that redirects to the original URL when clicked.

The purpose of URL shorteners is to make links more manageable and easier to share, especially on social media platforms like Twitter where character limits can be a constraint. When a user clicks on a shortened link, the URL shortener service takes them to an intermediate page that redirects them to the original URL. This can also be useful for tracking clicks and analyzing traffic to the original URL.
